# Adoption of oxfmt for Code Formatting and Module Normalization: Before Invoking Modifying Formatting Library Developers

These rules are ALWAYS ACTIVE for all first-party source code modules maintained within the repository.

### Rules

- **R-OXF-001** MUST: Before invoking or modifying the formatting library, developers MUST discover the repository dependency manifest and inspect the authoritative lock artifact to verify the exact resolved version of oxfmt.

### Verify

```bash
# Discover and execute the repository formatting verification script defined in the project manifest or run the formatting check command in non-modifying check mode.
```

**Accept when:**
- The discovered formatting verification command completes with zero syntax or style violations and an exit code of zero.
- All committed source files match the formatting rules declared in the repository configuration artifact.

<enforcement>
Claude Code MUST NOT skip or defer verification. Automated formatting checks enforce compliance on pull requests, and violations must be resolved by running the discovered repository formatting task prior to merge.
