# Oxlint Static Code Analysis Adoption: Codebase Use Oxlint Primary Static Code

Scope: applies to the whole repository; excludes `!apps/checker/**`, `!apps/dashboard/**`, `!apps/private-location/**`, `!apps/railway-proxy/**`, `!apps/screenshot-service/**`, `!apps/server/**`, `!apps/ssh-server/**`, `!apps/status-page/**`, `!apps/web/**`, `!apps/workflows/**`, `!packages/ai/**`, `!packages/analytics/**`, `!packages/api/**`, `!packages/assertions/**`, `!packages/db/**`, `!packages/emails/**`, `!packages/error/**`, `!packages/header-analysis/**`, `!packages/icons/**`, `!packages/importers/**`, `!packages/locales/**`, `!packages/notifications/base/**`, `!packages/notifications/bird-whatsapp/**`, `!packages/notifications/discord/**`, `!packages/notifications/email/**`, `!packages/notifications/google-chat/**`, `!packages/notifications/grafana-oncall/**`, `!packages/notifications/ms-teams/**`, `!packages/notifications/ntfy/**`, `!packages/notifications/opsgenie/**`, `!packages/notifications/pagerduty/**`, `!packages/notifications/slack/**`, `!packages/notifications/telegram/**`, `!packages/notifications/twillio-sms/**`, `!packages/notifications/webhook/**`, `!packages/proto/**`, `!packages/react/**`, `!packages/regions/**`, `!packages/services/**`, `!packages/status-fetcher/**`, `!packages/subscriptions/**`, `!packages/test-utils/**`, `!packages/theme-store/**`, `!packages/tinybird/**`, `!packages/tracker/**`, `!packages/tsconfig/**`, `!packages/ui/**`, `!packages/upstash/**`, `!packages/utils/**`.

These rules are ALWAYS ACTIVE for all source files and modules managed within the repository subject to static analysis.

### Rules

- **R-OX-001** MUST: The codebase MUST use Oxlint as the primary static code analysis and linting configuration engine for source code verification.

### Verify

```bash
# Discover and execute the static analysis verification script from the repository manifest
# Inspect the CI pipeline configuration to locate and run the linting check target
```

**Accept when:**
- Static analysis completes across all in-scope source files with zero diagnostic errors.
- The static analysis configuration module is validated by the execution engine without syntax or schema warnings.

<enforcement>
Claude Code MUST NOT skip or defer verification.
