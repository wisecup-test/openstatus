# net/http Core Library for HTTP Service Architecture and Client Transport: Server Lifecycle Implementations Coordinate Graceful Shutdown

Scope: applies to `apps/private-location/cmd/server/**`, `apps/private-location/internal/server/**`, `apps/private-location/internal/tinybird/**`, `apps/private-location/internal/workflows/**`, `apps/private-location/proto/private_location/v1/**`.

These rules are ALWAYS ACTIVE for all files matching the configured scope.

### Rules

- **R-NET-001** SHOULD: Server lifecycle implementations SHOULD coordinate graceful shutdown with operating system signal listeners to drain active connections before process termination.

### Verify

```bash
# Discover and execute the repository test suite to verify HTTP server handlers, client transports, and response writer implementations.
# Discover and run the repository static analysis and linting checks to ensure all HTTP clients configure explicit timeouts and pass context objects.
```

**Accept when:**
- All HTTP route handlers and client integration tests pass successfully without connection leaks or timeout errors.
- Static analysis verification confirms no unconfigured http.Client instances or context-less network calls exist.

<enforcement>
Claude Code MUST NOT skip or defer verification.
