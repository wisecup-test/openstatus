# net/http Core Library for HTTP Service Architecture and Client Transport: Service Packages Not Introduce External Web

Scope: applies to `apps/private-location/cmd/server/**`, `apps/private-location/internal/server/**`, `apps/private-location/internal/tinybird/**`, `apps/private-location/internal/workflows/**`, `apps/private-location/proto/private_location/v1/**`.

These rules are ALWAYS ACTIVE for all files matching the configured scope.

### Rules

- **R-NET-001** MUST_NOT: Service packages MUST_NOT introduce external web frameworks or custom networking abstractions that bypass standard http.Handler and http.ResponseWriter interfaces.

### Verify

```bash
# Discover and execute the repository test suite to verify HTTP server handlers, client transports, and response writer implementations.
# Discover and run the repository static analysis and linting checks to ensure all HTTP clients configure explicit timeouts and pass context objects.
```

**Accept when:**
- All HTTP route handlers and client integration tests pass successfully without connection leaks or timeout errors.
- Static analysis verification confirms no unconfigured http.Client instances or context-less network calls exist.

<enforcement>
Claude Code MUST NOT skip or defer verification.
